# Importing Used Household Articles and Personal Effects

Importing used household articles and personal effects into Singapore will incur  [Goods and Services Tax](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst) (GST).

You are required to  [obtain](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/) a Customs In-Payment (GST) permit to account for the import and the payment of GST.

Please see the tabs below for more information on the criteria for GST relief, application procedures and the types of used household or personal goods permitted for import.

## How to Qualify for GST Relief
GST relief may be granted on imports of used household articles and personal effects to:

-   Singaporeans and Permanent Residents of Singapore (PRs) residing overseas and returning to resume residence in Singapore
-   Foreigners transferring residence or migrating to Singapore

The GST relief is subject to the following conditions:

-   That such person satisfies Customs that:
    
    -   He is changing his place of residence from outside Singapore;
    -   He is the owner of the articles and personal effects imported;
    -   The articles and personal effects have been in his possession and used for a period of not less than 3 months; and
    -   He gives an undertaking not to dispose of the articles and personal effects within 3 months from the date of importation of such articles and personal effects.

-   The articles and personal effects and personal pets are imported within 6 months of his first arrival in Singapore.

***

## Goods Not Eligible for GST Relief
The import of intoxicating liquors, tobacco products, motor vehicles, private aircraft, boats, yachts and commercial goods by all persons, regardless of their status of transferring residence, will incur GST and duty (where applicable).

A Customs In-Payment (Duty and GST) permit is required for importing dutiable goods, while an In-Payment (GST) permit is required for importing non-dutiable goods.

Before you import your goods, please also see the lists of [controlled and prohibited goods](/businesses/importing-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-import) to check if your goods require authorisation beforehand.
