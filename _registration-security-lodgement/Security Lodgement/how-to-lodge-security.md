# How to Lodge Security 

You can lodge the security in the form of a Banker’s Guarantee (BG), Finance Company Guarantee or an Insurance Bond.

Download the [Security Application Form](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links) and bring it to your bank, finance company or insurance company for lodgement of the Banker’s Guarantee/Finance Company Guarantee/Insurance Bond. Please note that the processing by your bank, finance company or insurance company may **take up to three to four weeks**. You are encouraged to submit your new security to Customs **at least two weeks** before your intended date of shipment to allow sufficient time for processing and amendments in case of discrepancies.
