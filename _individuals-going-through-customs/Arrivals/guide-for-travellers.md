# Guide For Travellers 

Our [infographic](/files/individuals/Your%20Journey%20Back%20to%20Singapore%20(Infographic).pdf) provides a quick overview of customs formalities and clearance procedures for travellers.

Travellers may approach the Customs Examination Area before immigration clearance, Red Channel or the Singapore Customs Tax Payment Office on their arrival if they are unsure of the clearance procedures.
