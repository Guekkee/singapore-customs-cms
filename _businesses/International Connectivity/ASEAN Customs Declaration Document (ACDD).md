## Electronic exchange of the ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) under the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is a regional initiative that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS. <br> 

The ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) is an electronic document to facilitate the exchange of export declaration information between exchange-ready AMS. It contains a specific set of TradeNet export permit data, which will be sent to the Customs authority in the importing exchange-ready AMS for the purpose of supplementing risk management by the Customs authority in the importing country. The expected benefits for participating traders include potential reduction in Customs clearance time for consignments which are supported by the ACDD and imported into exchange-ready AMS. <br>

The ACDD is optional and open to all traders who export goods to an exchange-ready AMS. The exchange-ready AMS are: <br>
  a)  Brunei Darussalam<br>
	b)  Cambodia<br>
  c)  Indonesia<br>
	d)  Malaysia<br>
  e)  Myanmar<br>
	f)  Philippines<br>
  g)  Thailand<br>

More AMS will commence live operation when they are ready to do so.<br>

The specific TradeNet export permit data that would be sent as an ACDD to an importing exchange-ready AMS are:<br>

  a)  Exporter UEN<br>
  b)  Exporter Company Name<br>
  c)  Consignee Company Name<br>
  d)  Consignee Company Address<br>
  e)  Declaring Agent UEN<br>
  f)  Declaring Agent Company Name<br>
  g)  Departure Date<br>
  h)  Item HS Code<br>
  i)  Item HS Quantity<br>
  j)  Item HS Quantity UOM<br>
  k)  Item Country of Origin of Goods<br>
  l)  Outward Transport Mode<br>
  m)  Port of Discharge<br>
  n)  Serial Number of Item; and<br>
  o)  TradeNet Permit Number.<br>

## Participation in the Electronic Submission of ACDD

**Step 1: Participation in the Electronic Submission of ACDD and Authorisation of Singapore Customs to Transmit ACDD on the Networked Trade Platform (NTP)**<br><br>
Traders exporting goods out of Singapore who wish to participate in the electronic submission of ACDD can do so by logging in to the [NTP](https://www.ntp.gov.sg/home/) > Business Account > Manage Consent & Authorisation for NTP Services > Choose your International Connectivity Services & Authorise your Declaring Agent, to: <br>

  a)  provide their consent to Singapore Customs to send the ACDD-required information to the importing exchange-ready AMS and accept the relevant terms and conditions; and <br>
  b) inform Singapore Customs of their Declaring Agent(s) who are authorised to declare TradeNet export permit applications on their behalf.<br>

Traders who wish to withdraw their participation from the electronic submission of ACDD or update their list of authorised DA(s) can do so by logging in to [NTP](https://www.ntp.gov.sg/home/) > Business Account > Manage Consent & Authorisation for NTP Services > Choose your International Connectivity Services & Authorise your Declaring Agent.<br>



**Step 2: TradeNet Declaration Procedures for ACDD**<br><br> 
There will be no change to the TradeNet permit application procedures. To authorise Singapore Customs to send the ACDD to an importing exchange-ready AMS (specified in the “country of final destination” field in the export permit), the trader must provide their consent (described under Step 1), and the Declaring Agent has to indicate the following in the TradeNet application:<br>

  a)  “International Connectivity” under the “Customs Procedure Code (CPC)” field; and<br>
  b)  “ACDD” at the “Processing Code 1 (PC1)” field.

Please note that amendments to and/or cancellation of TradeNet permits will not be sent to the Customs authority of the importing exchange-ready AMS. Should there be any changes to the export information in the permits after the ACDD information has been sent to the importing exchange-ready AMS, please update the importing exchange-ready AMS of the changes.

"International Connectivity” under the “CPC” field is available for the following message and declaration types as shown below:

| Message Type | Declaration Type Reference |
|--|--|
| OUT | APS (Approved Premises / Schemes)|
|  | DRT (Direct) |
|  | TCS (Temporary Consignments previously imported with/without sales) |
|  | TCR (Temporary Consignments previously imported for repair) |
|  | TCE (Temporary Consignments previously imported for exhibition) |
|  | TCO (Temporary Consignments previously imported for other purposes) |
|  | TCI (Temporary Consignments for export / re-import of local goods) |
| INP (In-Non Payment)| REX (Re-Export) |
