# Authorised Self -Certification Regimes 
The authorised self-certification regime is a trade facilitation initiative under the selected Free Trade Agreements (FTA) which allow authorised exporters who have demonstrated their capacity to comply with the origin requirements to self-certify the originating status of their goods. This would bring about greater convenience to businesses by saving time and eliminating the need to obtain a Certificate of Origin (CO). 
 
There are currently 2 authorised self-certification regimes administered by Singapore Customs. 
-	ASEAN Wide Self Certification (AWSC) scheme under the ASEAN Trade in Good Agreement (ATIGA)
-	Approved Exporter Scheme under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP)
