## Electronic Exchange of Form D via the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is an environment that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS.

You may apply for e-Form under ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) if you are exporting to:

-   Brunei Darussalam
-   Cambodia;
-   Indonesia;    
-   Lao PDR;    
-   Malaysia;    
-   Myanmar;    
-   The Philippines
-   Thailand; and    
-   Vietnam.
    
Under the live operation of the ASW, a Form D under ATIGA and is electronically transmitted (therein called ATIGA e-Form D) from Singapore to any of the above-mentioned AMS for an import will also enjoy preferential tariff treatment. No other Certificates of Origin can currently be transmitted via the ASW.

To transmit an e-ATIGA Form D, the exporter must first be registered with Singapore Customs to access TradeNet. There is no change to the Form D application procedures in TradeNet. However, the applicant must access the approved Form D in the TradeNet Backend thereafter to authorise and trigger the transmission of the e-ATIGA Form D to the importing country via the ASW.

Detailed steps to perform the electronic transmission for the upcoming change in procedure can be found in this [handbook](/files/businesses/ttsb-roo/submitting%20and%20retrieving%20a%20form%20d%20via%20the%20asean%20single%20window%20(ics).pdf). You may refer to this [guidebook for the specific list of codes to be used for each field](https://go.gov.sg/codesrequiredforrespectivefieldsintn) as mentioned in the handbook on the electronic transmission of ATIGA e-form D via ASW.
