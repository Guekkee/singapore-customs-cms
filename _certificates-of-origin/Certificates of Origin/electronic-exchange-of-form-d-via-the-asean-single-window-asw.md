## Electronic Exchange of Form D via the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is an environment that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS.

You may apply for e-Form under ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) if you are exporting to:

-   Brunei Darussalam
-   Cambodia;
-   Indonesia;    
-   Lao PDR;    
-   Malaysia;    
-   Myanmar;    
-   The Philippines
-   Thailand; and    
-   Vietnam.
    
Under the live operation of the ASW, a Form D under ATIGA and is electronically transmitted (therein called ATIGA e-Form D) from Singapore to any of the above-mentioned AMS for an import will also enjoy preferential tariff treatment. No other Certificates of Origin can currently be transmitted via the ASW.

**Application Procedures**

There is no change made to the Form D application procedures in TradeNet. 

**For transmisison of an ATIGA e-Form D**

*  At the ATIGA Form D (SG to AMS) Enquiry screen, select "Importing Country / Region" and input  the approved Form D reference number to locate it.
