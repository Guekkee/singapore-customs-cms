# Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES) with China

The EODES, established on 1 November 2019, enables the electronic submission of Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) and the Certificate of Non-Manipulation (CNM) between Singapore and China Customs. With effect from 1 May 2020, China has implemented full electronic transmission of PCO eliminating the need for hardcopy Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) to be despatched overseas. With EODES, besides a shorter lead time to send PCO from Singapore to China and vice versa, the authenticity of the PCO is assured, thus reducing the goodsâ€™ time-to-market through potentially faster Customs clearance. To benefit from the potentially faster Customs clearance, exporters and their appointed declaring agents/freight forwarders should leverage on the International Connectivity PCO (IC PCO) service available on the Networked Trade Platform (NTP). 

Apart from exporters,importers who wish to claim preferential treatment for import of goods from China to Singapore or to apply for a back-to-back PCO would be able to retrieve the electronic PCO issued by China via the International Connectivity PCO (IC PCO) service. 

For more information on how you could sign up for the IC PCO service, please refer to [Notice 18/2019](/files/2019-10-15-N.pdf) under News and Media > Notices. Additonally, you may wish to download the [handbook](/files/businesses/Transmission and Receipt of Electronic Preferential Certificate of Origin via Networked Trade Platform December 2021.pdf) for the procedures in transmitting the PCO and CNM electronically to China.
