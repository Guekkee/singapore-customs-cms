# Free Trade Agreements under Self-Certification regime

**What is a Self-Certification regime?**

A Self-Certification regime allows exporters, producers or importers, depending on the specific Free Trade Agreement text, to self-certify the originating status of their goods under the respective Free Trade Agreement based on information available so that preferential tariff treatment is accorded for the goods imported. Self certifying requires the either the exporters, producers or importers to make our an origin declaration on a commercial document such as the commercial invoice, packing list, delivery note or bill of lading. 

The onus lies on the entity issuing the origin declaration to familiarise themselves with the Rules of Origin requirements and to certify that the goods being imported does meet the relevant criteria to be originating under the Free Trade Agreement. 

**Can I do Self-Certification and what are the requirements?** 

As of today, Singapore is a party to the following  Free Trade Agreements (FTA) as shown in the table below that allow self-certification. The Origin Declaration must contain specific data elements as prescribed in the specific FTA including information stating how the product qualifies for an FTA. You may find the FTAs as well as the relevant requirements and procedures in the table below. 

To self-certify under the ASEAN Trade-in Good Agreement (ATIGA) and under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP), please refer to “Approved Exporter and Certified Exporter Scheme”(Link).
